# Twitch API!

This is a fun project taken from `https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/use-the-twitch-json-api`
The idea is to work with twitch api to fetch some data.
The data being top 20 current twitch streams

## Personal take
The app is implemented with:
- React and Redux to manage state and front end
- Python Lambda to abstract getting Bearer token from the front end.
